Shooter Game 2D - using Swing and 2D Graphic Elements

### Description

This simple shooter game is a basic Java application that demonstrates the use of Java 2D graphics. In this game, the
player controls a square that can move left and right at the bottom of the window. The player can shoot projectiles
upwards to destroy incoming enemies from the top of the screen. The game ends if an enemy collides with the player.

### How to Run

To run the game, you need to have Java installed on your system. Follow these steps:


1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the SimpleShooterGame.java file.
3. Compile the Java file using the command: javac SimpleShooterGame.java
4. Run the compiled class with the command: java SimpleShooterGame

Make sure you're in the correct directory and have the necessary permissions to execute these commands.

### How to Play

* Use the **left** and **right** arrow keys to move the player left and right.
* Press the **spacebar** to shoot projectiles.
* Avoid letting enemies reach the player. Each enemy destroyed increases your score.
